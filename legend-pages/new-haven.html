        <h1>The Legends Project</h1>
        <p class="p3">
            <strong>A collection of stories that celebrates a primary orality and confronts the writing monopoly of
                histories.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This project curates and maps a diverse set of legends, myths, and oral histories from around the world.
            Each narrative was selected, researched, and contextualized by students in Yale’s S167 class.
        </p>
        <p>
            These legends are living archives, passed down through generations by voice and memory. This digital
            platform brings them together to honor oral traditions and demonstrate how they can be shared widely.
            Although each of us told a different story, we now carry the knowledge of them all. We have discovered new
            legends that we can continue to pass on. The map reminds us that a legend's origin is not its endpoint.
            Through this class and project, stories from around the world were gathered, connected, and shared in one
            classroom. This website was created to reflect that journey.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Each legend is pinned to a location on our interactive map, based on a place chosen by the student who
            shared it. Students created individual blocks on Are.na to present their selected stories. This website
            pulls directly from those blocks to showcase each legend. Clicking a marker reveals a summary and any
            additional details the student chose to share with us — and now with you.
